# Every company we ever tested or fixed on, for pick-forms.mjs (27 Oct 2026: the draw's list was made by hand once and lost; a weekly draw on CI
# rebuilds it): every web address (host + first path part) in the product repo's tracked files and in this repo's form lists and saved runs.
# Broad on purpose: a company named anywhere in our code is never drawn. pick-forms.mjs matches a company's slug inside this text.
# Usage: tools/excluded.sh <product checkout> <this repo> [more dirs, e.g. the weekly-picks branch] > excluded.txt   (sorted, one per line).
# Guard: test/excluded.test.mjs.
